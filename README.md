# CS 370: Computer Science Practicum (KWai AudioVisualizer)

This repository was a semester long project, where we gave weekly sprint updates to the class and practiced Agile/scrum methodology in developing our Windows/macOS application.
Our KWai AudioVisualizer has a small library of curated songs aimed to elicit specific emotions in users. We also accompany those songs with dynamically programmed visualizations
using Java-based Processing (more info here: https://processing.org/reference/libraries/) to amplify the emotions we hope to elicit in users. This project was built with Maven,
Gradle, and JavaFx. I worked on the back-end and helped the team implement JDBC connections to a Google Cloud Platform hosted MySQL server to help track user usage. 
Our team was led by Noah Okada and consisted of Matthew Joesoep, Asuka Li, Ameer Husary, Abdullah Hamid, Joseph Pogue, and myself.
